SOLID is a collection of five object oriented design principles that go nicely
together. Hereâ€™s a super brief summary pulled from the wikipedia page on the
topic:


* Single responsibility principle: a class should have only a single responsibility and should have only one reason to change.



* Open/closed principle: software entities like class, module, function should be open for extension, but closed for modification.



* Liskov substitution principle: objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program. Derived types must be completely replaceable for their base types.



* Interface segregation principle: many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.



* Dependency inversion principle: depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
