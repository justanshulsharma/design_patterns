SOLID is a collection of five object oriented design principles that go nicely
together. Hereâ€™s a super brief summary pulled from the wikipedia page on the
topic:


* Single responsibility principle: an object should have only a single responsibility.



* Open/closed principle: an object should be open for extension, but closed for modification.



* Liskov substitution principle: objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program



* Interface segregation principle: many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.



* Dependency inversion principle: depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concretions
