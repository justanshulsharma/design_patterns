#Implementation
#       Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter 
#       that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
#       Map a domain to a language, the language to a grammar, and the grammar to 
#       a hierarchical object-oriented design
#       
#       Interpreter pattern is just the use of the composite pattern applied to represent a grammar. 
#       The Interpreter defines the behaviour while the composite defines only the structure
#
#Applicability & Examples
#       The Interpreter pattern is used exaustively in defining grammars, tokenize input and store it.
#       A specific area where Interpreter can be used are the rules engines
#       The Interpreter pattern can be used to add functionality to the composite pattern
