###Creational design patterns
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation
mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The
basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added
complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by
somehow controlling this object creation.

This design patterns is all about class instantiation. This pattern can be
further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation
process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job
done.
